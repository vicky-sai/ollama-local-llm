## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Ollama**: Ollama is used to run the model files. [Ollama installation guide](https://ollama.com/)
- **Python 3**: You'll need Python 3 to set up the HTTP server.
- **Terminal or Command Line Interface**: We will be running commands through the terminal.

## Steps

### Step 1: Install Ollama

If you do not have Ollama installed on your system, you can install it by following the official instructions from the [Ollama installation guide](https://ollama.com/).

Once installed, you should be able to use the `ollama` command in your terminal.

### Step 2: Download the Model Files

To download the model files, you need to run two different commands in two separate terminals.

#### Terminal 1: Download the `gemma3:1b` Model
In your first terminal, run the following command:

```bash
ollama run gemma3:1b
```

This will download the `gemma3:1b` model.

#### Terminal 2: Download the `gemma3` Model
In your second terminal, run the following command:

```bash
ollama run gemma3
```

This will download the `gemma3` model.

Both commands will download model files that you can use for local operations.

### Step 3: Set Up the HTTP Server

Once the model files are downloaded, you need to serve them using a simple HTTP server. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. **Navigate to the Folder Containing the Model Files**:  
   Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where the model files were downloaded. For example:

   ```bash
   cd /path/to/ollama-local-llm
   ```

2. **Start the HTTP Server**:  
   Run the following command to start a basic HTTP server on port 8000:

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

   This will start a simple HTTP server, and the model files will be accessible via `http://localhost:8000`.

### Step 4: Access the Model Files

After starting the server, you can access the model files from your browser or other tools by navigating to:

```
http://localhost:8000
```

You can now interact with the model files via the HTTP server you've set up.

## Troubleshooting

- **Ollama Command Not Found**: If you encounter the error `command not found: ollama`, it means Ollama is not installed correctly. Please follow the installation instructions provided in the Ollama documentation.
- **Port 8000 Already in Use**: If port 8000 is already in use by another process, you can specify a different port by changing the `8000` in the `python3 -m http.server` command. For example, use `8080`:

   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server 8080
   ```

## Conclusion

You have successfully downloaded and set up Ollama models, and you've created an HTTP server to serve them locally. You can now use these models and interact with them through a web interface.

If you need more help, refer to the [official Ollama documentation](https://ollama.com/docs) for additional details.

This `README.md` provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide to downloading the models and setting up a basic HTTP server to serve the model files.
